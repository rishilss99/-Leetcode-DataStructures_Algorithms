# Power of Four

## Problem

Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Logic

This is a pretty straight forward problem when using recursion or loops. However, as the follow up states tackling it without using looping or recursion is the real challenge. Using the test cases given and the property of powers of four i.e., bit 1 at odd positions of the bit representation of the number is able to get the solution using a single return statement.

## Important Points

- Bit manipulation

- Powers
